maxspeed is for calculating the long-term max speed.

nclt loader: load the nclt data

newdata.py and newloader.py is to make a smaller dataset for quick test.

normal.py is to plot the data point.

plot loss is to plot the loss.

ran.py is to generate random numbers to split the dataset into train/val/test randomly.

train.py is to train a normal rnn.

train2.py is to train a ltl-constrained rnn.

visualizeNew.py is to visualize the dataset.
