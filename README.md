# LTL-RNN  
**Predict trajectory with LTL-constrained RNN**

This repository contains scripts for preprocessing datasets, training models, and visualizing results, designed to integrate Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) constraints into a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) for trajectory prediction tasks.


## **Installation**

To install the required dependencies, run the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
---


## **Datasets**

Download the required datasets from the following sources:

- [ETH BIWI Walking Pedestrians Dataset](https://icu.ee.ethz.ch/research/datsets.html)  
  This dataset contains short-term pedestrian trajectories and is used for initial experiments.

- [NCLT Dataset](https://robots.engin.umich.edu/nclt/)  
  This dataset provides long-term trajectories and is used for extended predictions and evaluations.

Make sure to place the downloaded datasets in the appropriate directories as specified in the scripts or preprocessing instructions.


For the NCLT dataset, convert the CSV files into `.npz` format sequences, ensuring that the resulting `.npz` files contain the following keys:  
```python
self.x = self.data['x']
self.y = self.data['y']
```
## **Code Overview**

### **Preprocessing and Utilities**
- **`maxmin.py`**  
  Calculates the maximum and minimum values of the speed across the dataset. Useful for setting normalization or constraint thresholds.

- **`maxspeed.py`**  
  Computes the long-term maximum speed, aiding in defining velocity constraints.

- **`nclt_loader.py`**  
  Loads and processes the NCLT dataset for training and evaluation. Ensures the data is prepared in a format suitable for RNN models.

- **`newdata.py`**  
  Creates a smaller version of the dataset, intended for quick testing and debugging.

- **`newloader.py`**  
  Loads the smaller dataset generated by `newdata.py`, enabling faster iterations during testing.

---

### **Visualization**
- **`normal.py`**  
  Plots data points from the dataset for a quick overview of its structure and distribution.

- **`plot_loss.py`**  
  Generates plots for training and testing loss over epochs, helping to visualize model performance and convergence.

- **`visualizeNew.py`**  
  Visualizes the preprocessed dataset, providing insights into how the data is segmented and structured.

---

### **Training and Model Development**
- **`ran.py`**  
  Generates random splits of the dataset into training, validation, and test sets. Ensures reproducibility and balanced subsets.

- **`train.py`**  
  Trains a standard RNN without LTL constraints on the trajectory dataset.

- **`train2.py`**  
  Trains an RNN with LTL constraints applied to enforce logical and physical rules on the model's outputs.

---

## **How to Run**
To train the models and visualize results, execute the following commands:

```bash
# Train a standard RNN
python train.py

# Train an LTL-constrained RNN
python train2.py
```

### **ETH-BIWI Dataset Training and Visualization**

Within the `ETH-BIWI` folder, the following Jupyter notebooks are provided to handle training and visualization for the two subsets of the ETH dataset:

- **`eth_finalpoint.ipynb`**  
  This notebook contains the training and visualization code for the ETH dataset.

- **`hotel_finalpoint.ipynb`**  
  This notebook provides the training and visualization code for the Hotel subset of the ETH dataset.

Use these notebooks to explore and visualize the results for the respective subsets of the ETH-BIWI dataset.
